        <h3 class="description">Bulgogi is a dish that my dad made when I was younger since my family is Mormon and he personally went on a mission to South Korea.
            this gave him the love for Korean food and therefore passed it onto me for his love of asian food in his life. Bulgogi is a simple
            beef marinated in a sweet and savory marinade dish that you put onto rice. This has been such a wonderful meal that my dad makes and will
            <em>always</em> be special in my heart.
