        <h3 class="description">Fried rice is very similar to bulgogi but mostly with getting take out from Panda Express a lot or just asian restaurants in general.
            It was always a great day anytime my family brings home asian food from a local restaurant called Lil' Wok since I would fill up my plate 
            with lo mein, fried rice, teriyaki, and orange chicken and be on my way to my room to watch some YouTube as I ate my food.
