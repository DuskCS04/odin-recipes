        <h3 class="description">I love Chicken Curry since as I grew up through Highschool I had a friend who always brought chicken curry to school and it always smelled amazing.
            So one day I decided, instead of eating school lunch, I wanted to make my own chicken curry! So this was the beginning of my love for chicken curry
            and how It created bonds with my friends in High School.
